Fortran (short for *Formula Translation*) was widely used in early nutrition and epidemiological research for simulations, statistical modeling, and numerical computations. In this notebook, we’ll use Fortran to calculate a simple nutritional index based on dietary intakes, bringing a bit of historical flair to our modern data science toolkit.\n",
